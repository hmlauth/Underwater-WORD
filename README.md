## How to Swim
- Take a moment to learn about some pretty awesomely dangerous sea creatures. Once you feel ready to take on King Poseidon, <em>on his turf</em>, jump in!
- Once you Take a Dive! a randomly generated word will be selected. Blank placeholders will be displayed on the screen provinding a clue to the length of the word and if it's one or two words. 
- You now have 10 attempts at guessing letters to formulate the word. (HINT. . . start with vowels!)
- Guess right - you'll successfully steer clear of some of the most dangerous sea animals!
- Guess wrong - you'll suffer a miserable death. 
- Either way, you'll be sure to learn a lot and see things never seen before!
